# AsanaApiClient.Model.GoalResponseAllOfMetric

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Gid** | **string** | Globally unique identifier of the resource, as a string. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ResourceType** | **string** | The base type of this resource. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ResourceSubtype** | **string** | The subtype of this resource. Different subtypes retain many of the same fields and behavior, but may render differently in Asana or represent resources with different semantic meaning. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Precision** | **int** | *Conditional*. Only relevant for goal metrics of type &#x60;Number&#x60;. This field dictates the number of places after the decimal to round to, i.e. 0 is integer values, 1 rounds to the nearest tenth, and so on. Must be between 0 and 6, inclusive. For percentage format, this may be unintuitive, as a value of 0.25 has a precision of 0, while a value of 0.251 has a precision of 1. This is due to 0.25 being displayed as 25%. | [optional] 
**Unit** | **string** | A supported unit of measure for the goal metric, or none. | [optional] 
**CurrencyCode** | **string** | ISO 4217 currency code to format this custom field. This will be null if the &#x60;unit&#x60; is not &#x60;currency&#x60;. | [optional] 
**InitialNumberValue** | **decimal** | This number is the start value of a goal metric of type number. | [optional] 
**TargetNumberValue** | **decimal** | This number is the end value of a goal metric of type number. This number cannot equal &#x60;initial_number_value&#x60;. | [optional] 
**CurrentNumberValue** | **decimal** | This number is the current value of a goal metric of type number. | [optional] 
**CurrentDisplayValue** | **string** | This string is the current value of a goal metric of type string. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ProgressSource** | **string** | This field defines how the progress value of a goal metric is being calculated. A goal&#39;s progress can be provided manually by the user, calculated automatically from contributing subgoals, projects, or tasks, or managed by an integration with an external data source, such as Salesforce. | [optional] 
**IsCustomWeight** | **bool** | *Conditional*. Only relevant if &#x60;metric.progress_source&#x60; is one of &#x60;subgoal_progress&#x60;, &#x60;project_task_completion&#x60;, &#x60;project_milestone_completion&#x60;, or &#x60;task_completion&#x60;. If true, we use the supporting object&#39;s custom weight to calculate the goal&#39;s progress. If false, we treat all supporting objects as equally weighted | [optional] 
**CanManage** | **bool** | *Conditional*. Only relevant for &#x60;progress_source&#x60; of type &#x60;external&#x60;. This boolean indicates whether the requester has the ability to update the current value of this metric. This returns &#x60;true&#x60; if the external metric was created by the requester, &#x60;false&#x60; otherwise. | [optional] [readonly]
