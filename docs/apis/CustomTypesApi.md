# **GetCustomType**
> GetCustomType200Response GetCustomType (string customTypeGid, bool optPretty = null, List<string> optFields = null)

Get a custom type

Returns the complete custom type record for a single custom type.


### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| **customTypeGid** | **string** | Globally unique identifier for the custom type. |  |
| **optPretty** | **bool** | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. | [optional]  |
| **optFields** | [**List&lt;string&gt;**](string.md) | This endpoint returns a resource which excludes some properties by default. To include those optional properties, set this query parameter to a comma-separated list of the properties you wish to include. | [optional]  |

### Return type

[**GetCustomType200Response**](GetCustomType200Response.md)

### Authorization

[personalAccessToken](../README.md#personalAccessToken), [oauth2](../README.md#oauth2)

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: Not defined
 - **Accept**: application/json


### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **200** | Successfully retrieved the requested custom type. |  -  |
| **400** | This usually occurs because of a missing or malformed parameter. Check the documentation and the syntax of your request and try again. |  -  |
| **401** | A valid authentication token was not provided with the request, so the API could not associate a user with the request. |  -  |
| **403** | The authentication and request syntax was valid but the server is refusing to complete the request. This can happen if you try to read or write to objects or properties that the user does not have access to. |  -  |
| **404** | Either the request method and path supplied do not specify a known action in the API, or the object specified by the request does not exist. |  -  |
| **500** | There was a problem on Asana’s end. In the event of a server error the response body should contain an error phrase. These phrases can be used by Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server error. Some errors are due to server load, and will not supply an error phrase. |  -  |

# **GetCustomTypes**
> GetCustomTypes200Response GetCustomTypes (string project, bool optPretty = null, int limit = null, string offset = null, List<string> optFields = null)

Get all custom types associated with an object

Returns a list of all of the custom types associated with an object. Currently, only projects are supported. Note that, as in all queries to collections which return compact representation, `opt_fields` can be used to include more data than is returned in the compact representation. See the [documentation for input/output options](https://developers.asana.com/docs/inputoutput-options) for more information.


### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| **project** | **string** | Globally unique identifier for the project, which is used as a filter when retrieving all custom types. |  |
| **optPretty** | **bool** | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. | [optional]  |
| **limit** | **int** | Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100. | [optional]  |
| **offset** | **string** | Offset token. An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results. *Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.* | [optional]  |
| **optFields** | [**List&lt;string&gt;**](string.md) | This endpoint returns a resource which excludes some properties by default. To include those optional properties, set this query parameter to a comma-separated list of the properties you wish to include. | [optional]  |
